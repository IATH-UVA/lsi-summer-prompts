# LSI-Prep for working between design & code 

Across the summer, we will be working in javascript to mock-up different reading experiences, examine opportunities to integration textual and visual mark-up, and generally explore how the Landscape Studies Platform might offer alternate collation and visualization of landscape documents. To ground a larger array of work - with field imagery, sensor data, and distributed (api-sourced) digital texts - the entire LSI team will begin this May by getting an initial grasp on the structures, syntax, and affordances of 'data' and computation. 

*To assist in the acquisition of data/code literacy, please install the following programs and, for those unfamiliar with them, complete the introductory tutorials linked below by Wednesday May 23rd:*


+ get comfortable with the command line interface - [complete the code academy tutorial on CLI](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
   
   We'll work with Code Academy tutorials - *free access* - in preparation for building custom functions, scripts, and programs. If you don't have an account, please sign-up now.
---
+ [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
+ [install npm - node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   
   We'll start using node on Wednesday and will explore how it structures/enables web development, serving files, and modular programming then... 
---
+ [install git - for version control and team coordination](https://git-scm.com/)
+ [sign-up for a free github account](https://github.com/siteations/lsi-summer-prompts)
+ [complete the basic git tutorial on code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
   
   We'll work extensively with git to track and share work. Once you've installed git, signed up to github, and done the tutorial (if necessary), make sure to send me your github name so I can invite you to be a collaborator the lsi-repositories. 
---
+ [install the sublime text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   
   This is where we will spend most of the time coding. We'll look through setting and options during the first week to orient users and coordinate materials.
---
+ [sign-up for repl.it](https://repl.it/)
   
   We'll do the initial days exercises and problems on repl.it's instant development environment. Having an account means you'll be able to save work and return to a problem set or issue. This is also handy for solving discrete functions and testing them immediately, in advance of integrating them within larger programs.
   
For all of this installation and tutorial activity, please track your time spent. It will be incorporated into your hours for the first week.
