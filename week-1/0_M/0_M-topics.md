# LSI- #

### Monday. May 21st. ###

*general agenda* 
---
Across the summer, we will be working in javascript to mock-up different reading experiences, examine opportunities to integration textual and visual mark-up, and generally explore how the Landscape Studies Platform might offer alternate collation and visualization of landscape documents. To ground a larger array of work - with field imagery, sensor data, and distributed (api-sourced) digital texts - the entire LSI team will begin this May by getting an initial grasp on the structures, syntax, and affordances of 'data' and computation.
