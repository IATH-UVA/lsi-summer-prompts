//------------button objects/classes-------------------------------

/*

start a new sketch. canvas should be the size of the window again

write a Button object (for creating new Button instances) that takes an index number as it's 'label' (so you can iterate through and create 8 buttons)

position these buttons at the bottom of the page - where each is 80 pixels wide and offset by 80 pixels - and center the label on each button

when you mouseOver a button it should fill with magenta, mouseOut it should return to white ; click on it should turn red, clicked when on and it should turn back to white

a successful sketch will  include, at minimum setup(), draw(), and button() functions and the above behavior
