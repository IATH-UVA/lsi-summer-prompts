### Lunch

*2* Code Review
   
   As much as you're still learning javascript and the paper.js library, for this review you should speak about a) high level goals - why you might visualize elements in the manner choosen, b) your development approach/pieces - the process and you took breaking down the task into specific pieces or components, and c) where you would start to refactor or continue troubleshooting to get the whole thing working. 
   
   Focus on your presentation skills from design and how to incorporate those in how you speak strategically about what you are building/showing. 

*3* Design Thinking - approaches to prototyping, iterative development, and minimum viable demonstrations of an idea.
   
   There will be a number of readings and power-points to come, which will be posted in the 'readings' folder. Stay tuned.
