*general agenda* 
---

*10* Review of Thursday general questions, also coding challenge opportunities [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

*10:30* review and catch-up on current button and animation practice with classes [last prompt](../3_Th/index_02.js) continue working on those manipulation functions through lunch, I'll trouble shoot as is helpful and useful as you build additional animation features.

   We'll walk through everyone's code before lunch, around 12:20-1pm. Creative embellishments and alternate visualization ideas are welcome and encouraged.

*12:30* Code Review - reference for above -
   
   As much as you're still learning javascript and the p5js library, for this review you should speak about a) high level goals - what drew you to specific elements, what code/parameters elements you were looking to explore, b) your development approach/pieces - the process and you took breaking down the task into specific pieces or components, and c) where you would start to refactor or continue troubleshooting to get the whole thing working. 
   
   Focus on your presentation skills from design and how to incorporate those in how you speak strategically about what you are building/showing.

*2* Design Thinking - approaches to prototyping, iterative development, and minimum viable demonstrations of an idea.There are a number of readings and pdfs posted in the 'readings' folder. Stay tuned... as we'll go through a round of design thinking together and examine/re-design everyone's experience with digital reading.

*4-6pm* Engaging outside data and media elements in p5 or looking at paper.js (popular choice... tackling new code approaches or integrating more materials.)
