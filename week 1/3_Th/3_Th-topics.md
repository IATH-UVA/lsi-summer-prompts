+ [p5 instance mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview#instantiation--namespace)
+ [paper.js scoping](http://paperjs.org/tutorials/getting-started/using-javascript-directly/#setting-up-a-scope)

   We'll walk through the webpack materials together to set-up a new working environment for running a revised sketch. We'll break at noon for lunch given my scheduled meetings and reassemble at 1pm to do a p5 modular build in the afternoon.

### Lunch
---

*1* Adapt your p5 button/emitters sketch for the modular build. Based on web-pack, I've attached a basic webpack and node set-up for you to begin from in this conversion. As with yesterday, save a copy of this folder with your initials for working within. Start by doing 'npm -i p5 --save' to make the node module available and translate your work into the in your starting file structures. I've left the framework of instance mode in the file itself. See p5 instance mode above.
+ [starting setup with node and webpack](./webpack-p5/)
   
   We'll review progress and process at 2pm before starting a new sketch - exploring raster sampling in paper.js. I'll also post solutions in both p5.js and paper.js for modular building.

*3* Images as Data - sampling and visualization in paper.js
+ [paper - image as data prompt](./webpack-paper-image/)

   Read the prompt posted above in the webpack-paper-image setup. Copy folder and rename. You should be able to get to the #4 filters or #5 sorting functions by 6pm. We'll return to this Friday afternoon for additional build-out and interactions.
