//------------initial mouse conditional adapted---------------------

/*

first - create a function that explores the current window size - use mozilla's references on the DOM and p5's references to output size to the console

second - change the drawing framerate and appearance attributes of the ellipse being drawn

third - create a non-looping version of this initial interaction that modifies and ellipse based on the mouse location. Use the mouse being pressed to initiate the drawing of a new ellipse.
