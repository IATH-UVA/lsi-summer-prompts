*10* Review of Wednesday and general questions, also coding challenge opportunities [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

*10:30* P5.js and paper.js library introductions *code and compare* for starting to build visual feedback [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)

*11* Starting a simple project: with node, http-server, and basic html/css/js file relationships - we'll build through this together -
+ [using a local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)
+ [set-up or copy the basic file structures](https://p5js.org/get-started/#file-setup)

   For ease coordination, set-up this example within the lsi-summer-prompts folder, within your named folder and name a subfolder for this work 'p5Start'
   
   As you open different prompts for the day, you should save them into your folder - to work out solutions and simply update the link from your index.html

---
*11:30ish - 1pm* Exercises - modification and interaction with the 'get started' file (use your new js knowledge and explore p5's documentation)
+ [simple modifications](./index-00.js)

+ feel free to create addition sketches, copy and paste examples and console.log through existing code pieces to understand different interactions


---
### Lunch
---
*2ish* Review solutions and build out - we'll look over your insertions before adding additional elements to the sketch. 

*2-on* Exercises - extended modifications - practicing classes in the p5 environment
+ [complex 1 - emitter objects or a class of animation of any sort](./index-02.js)
+ [complex 2 - button objects](./index-01.js)
+ [complex 3 - integration of objects and interactions](./index-03.js) 

*5pm* Review solutions and approaches - (also compare p5.js code and paper.js code) - 

   
   I'll post links to completed samples built in both libraries. Here, I want you to consider what basic javascript understandings and approaches you're working with, as well as considering how the methods built into libraries (and their oop approach) affect your ability to create advanced interactions easily.
   
   Look over the code closely and get familiar with different elements/approaches. (comment sections on and off to explore) We're going to work with p5.js Thursday morning, and continue to explore in paper.js Thursday afternoon.
