# LSI- 

### Wednesday. May 23nd.

*general agenda* 
---

*10* Review of Tuesday and general questions, also coding challenge opportunities [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

*10:30* P5.js and paper.js library introductions *code and compare* for starting to build visual feedback [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)

*11* Starting a simple project: with node, http-server, and basic html/css/js file relationships - we'll build through this together -
+ [using a local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)
+ [set-up or copy the basic file structures](https://p5js.org/get-started/#file-setup)

   For ease coordination, set-up this example within the lsi-summer-prompts folder, within week1/2_W and name your overarching folder 'p5Start[your intials]' *eg.'p5StartYC*
   
   As you open different prompts for the day, you should save them into your folder - to work out solutions and simply update the link from your index.html

---
*11:30ish* Exercises - modification and interaction with the 'get started' file (use your new js knowledge and explore p5's documentation)
+ [simple modifications](./index-00.js)
+ [complex 1 - button objects](./index-01.js)

---
### Lunch
---
*2ish* Review solutions and build out - we'll take a bit more time to look over your multiple button instances and approach before adding additional elements to the sketch. 

*3* Exercises - extended modifications
+ [complex 2 - emitter objects](./index-02.js)
+ [complex 3 - integration of objects and interactions](./index-03.js) 

*4:30 or 5pm* Review solutions and approaches - compare p5.js code and paper.js code - 
   
   I'll post links to completed samples built in both libraries. Here, I want you to consider what basic javascript understandings and approaches you're working with, as well as considering how the methods built into libraries (and their oop approach) affect your ability to create advanced interactions easily.
   
   Look over the code closely and get familiar with different elements/approaches. (comment sections on and off to explore) We're going to work with p5.js Thursday morning, and continue to explore in paper.js Thursday afternoon.
