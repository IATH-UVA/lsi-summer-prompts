### Lunch
---
+ [Calculator](https://repl.it/@siteations/LSI-Calculator)
+ [Fibonacci](https://repl.it/@siteations/LSI-Fibonacci) - we'll talk through recursion here and base-case structuring.
+ other tbd.
   
   You'll have 30 on either side of lunch, in teams to create functions and then we're review your solutions and approaches between 2:30 and 3:00.

*3* Javascript- objects and classes [intro to js](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

*4* Additional info on coding / code references
+ object lessons - [prototypical inheritance 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain),  [prototypical inheritance 2](http://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/02/22/a-plain-english-guide-to-javascript-prototypes/)
+ walk through inheritance and constructor usage *whiteboard overview*

---
*5ish* Exercises
+ (Mammals, Cats, Kittens)[https://repl.it/@siteations/LSI-Mammal]
+ Vehicles, Types, Models  *to be built together*
   
   We'll likely build through objects and prototype inheritance together, given the need to understand how these structures work in object-oriented-programming and the limited afternoon time.
