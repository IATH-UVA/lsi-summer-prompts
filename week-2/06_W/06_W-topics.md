### Wednesday. May 30th. ###

*general agenda* 
---
Welcome back from Memorial day. We began last week with code syntax and creative manipulation of the canvas, with js, using the libraries of p5.js and paper.js. This week, we'll continue to make small, functional programs in order to build your skills at interacting with, sorting, and manipulating data. Moving beyond the canvas, we'll look at integrating dom elements (html/css structure), using asynchronous calls to other sites, and working with restful api to query databases.
